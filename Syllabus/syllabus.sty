Attendance and active participation in class are required. There is no
penalty for the first #1 absences; for every unexcused absence over
the first #1, your class participation/attendance grade will be
reduced by #2 percentage points. Being late for class, lack of
attention, not taking notes, etc. may also reduce your grade. If you
miss class, you are still responsible for all material that is covered
and all announcements that are made. Make-up exams are normally only
given if the absence is beyond the student's control. You must notify
me in advance if you will miss an exam.  }

\newcommand{\SyllabusSeminarAttendance}{%
\flushleft

Your attendance and participation grade will be determined using the following rules. Any days that you are up to 5 minutes late, 5 percentage points will be deducted from your semester attendance grade. If you are 10 or more minutes late, 10 percentage points will be deducted from your semester attendance grade unless you are granted an excused absence. Rude behavior such as talking during a presentation will also result in up to 10 percentage points per class session being deducted from your semester attendance grade. Asking appropriate questions also contributes to your attendance/participation grade. }

Laptops and cell phones are to be turned off or put on vibrate and put away during the class. Studies have shown that short distractions diminish your ability to comprehend material and they also distract the students sitting near you. Use of a cell phone or other similar electronic devices during class will result in deductions in your Attendance/Participation grade.
